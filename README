Summary

Nethook is a daemon that runs scripts when network interfaces change state.

Usage

When a network interface goes down, the following locations are checked for scripts. If they exist and are executable, they are run.

    /etc/nethook/ifup.d/*
    /etc/nethook/ifup-$DEVICE 

Similarly, when a network interface goes up, the following locations are checked for scripts to run.

    /etc/nethook/ifdown.d/*
    /etc/nethook/ifdown-$DEVICE 

Prior to running the scripts, nethook parses /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-$DEVICE if it exists and makes the variables set in it available in the scripts' environment.
